## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique follows these steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer for 25 minutes (one pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short 5-minute break
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

## Features

- 25-minute focus timer
- 5-minute break timer
- Simple, clean user interface
- Real-time timer updates
- Automatic session tracking with browser cookies
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Using the Application

1. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL
2. **Start a Focus Session**: Click the "Focus" button to start a 25-minute focus session
3. **Pause if Needed**: Click the button again to pause the timer
4. **Take a Break**: When the focus session ends, click the "Break" button to start a 5-minute break
5. **Repeat**: Continue alternating between focus and break sessions

The application automatically saves your session state, so you can close your browser and return later to continue where you left off.
